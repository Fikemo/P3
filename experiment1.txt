PLAYER 1 = mcts_vanilla, PLAYER 2 = mcts_vanilla2

--------------------------------------------

PLAYER 2 at 50 nodes
Final win counts: {'draw': 0, 1: 75, 2: 25}
150.02486689999998  seconds

In this case, a fifty node tree loses against a 100 node tree.

--------------------------------------------

PLAYER 2 at 100 nodes
Final win counts: {'draw': 4, 1: 55, 2: 41}
195.8535733  seconds

This is a 100 node tree against a 100 node tree. Results should be
50/50. This is a result of luck

--------------------------------------------

PLAYER 2 at 200 nodes
Final win counts: {'draw': 2, 1: 37, 2: 61}
286.83255560000003  seconds

This is a 100 node tree against a 200 node tree. Results
are in correlation to size of tree

--------------------------------------------

PLAYER 2 at 500 nodes
Final win counts: {'draw': 0, 1: 27, 2: 73}
568.4297359000001  seconds

100 node tree against 500. It is very appearent that the 
bigger the tree mcts, the better the results will be;
however, the run is increased as a result of increasing
nodes.
