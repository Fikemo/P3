Analysis:
The modified version does almost consistently win more games when playing against the vanilla version.
Although some times the vanilla version gets a bit lucky causing win counts to be close, or even the same as was the case with the 200 node test.
It seems that the advantages and disadvantages each bot has remains the same as long as their node counts are equal
